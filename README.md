# Clustering Project
Project undertaken as part of Marketing Analytics module in my Master's Degree

Customer Clustering project undertaken using IBM SPSS Modeller 17.
Project used fictional survey data from Tesco and clustered customers based on answers to survey questions.
Clusters were then analysed to discover Customer Lifetime Value and Total Segment Value.

Key Findings:

Tesco's should split up Marketing efforts into 4 different campaigns that target similar customer segmentations and offer discounts / offers based on segment priorities.
  
  a) Cluster 1 = Prioritise Price
  
  b) Cluster 2 = Prioritise Healthy + Local Food
  
  c) Cluster 3 = Prioritise Shopping Experience
  
  d) Cluster 4 = No main priority
